# Chip8-EMU

Basically the hello world equivalent of emulator develpment. This is a warmup for developing a Z80/6502 Emulator, so I hope you enjoy it!

## Changelog (Version 1.4.4)

Completed most Configurable Quirks (Uncomment in main.c to enable, DISPWAIT and CLIP coming soon)

## Installation  

Once SDL3 is installed on your system, follow these steps to install and run the Emulator:  

```bash  
git clone
cd CHIP8-EMU
make clean && make
./bin/chip8
```  

## Roadmap  

I do not have any plans to implement Audio at this time, as I want to end up porting this to the TI 84 Plus CE, which obviously has no sound. Besides that, here's a few other features I'd want to add.

- [x] Improve Input Delay
- [x] Load Roms from the Command Line
- [x] Opcode Function Pointers
- [ ] Super Chip-48 Support
- [ ] TI-84 Plus CE Port
- [ ] GUI Rom Loading & Configuration

## Credits/Thanks
